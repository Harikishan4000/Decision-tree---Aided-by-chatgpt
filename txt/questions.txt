A manager must decide on the size of a video arcade to construct. The manager has narrowed the choices to two: large or small. Demand can be either low or high with probabilities of 0.4 and 0.6 respectively. If small facility is built, and at low demand the payoff is Rs 40000. If small facility is built and demand is high then there are three options again: do nothing (Rs 40000) and do overtime (Rs 55000) and expand (Rs 55000).  If building large facility is considered and the demand is low you have two options: do nothing (Rs 10000) and reduce prices (Rs 50000). If large facility is built and demand is high the payoff is Rs 70000.
