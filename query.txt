I will provide you with a set of statements consisting of multiple events. I want you to convert that into a set of statements into inputs of two types, decision nodes and cost nodes.

Decision nodes are those that have a probability of occurring and/or lead to other events taking place. There are usually probability or decimal values that accompany such nodes. Convert such decimal values to percentages if present.

Cost nodes are the nodes that have certain values associated with them. These are usually a result of a certain decision node.

Create the output in json format with fields:
Id: root node is 0 and increment the id for each new node
 Name of node: Mentions the name of the node,
type of node: Mentions if it is a decision node or a cost node,
level: Mentions the level at which the node is present with respect to the root node,
Payoff: if it is a cost node,
probability: if it is a decision node,
parent: id of the parent
children: which consists of the array of children for each node
and also create an output of form,
The output should mentions the decisions to be taken in just a couple of words and the all the  decisions that are made based on it to follow the parent decision with a preceding "->" along with the probability/percentage in parentheses and the cost nodes that are based on this decision should follow its parent decision with a preceding "->" along with the cost in parentheses.
Make sure the first node's type is always "Root".
Make sure the current node's Id is added into the children array of the parent node.
Each parent can have more than 2 children if required.
Make sure the field names are in lowercase.
